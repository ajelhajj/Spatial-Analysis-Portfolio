# Spatial-Analysis-Portfolio
This Repository contains a portfolio of nine research reports in the area of spatial analysis along with the datasets that I used to create them. 

"Analysis of Vermont Social Survey and US Census Data"
  - VT_SOCSURVEY.sav is a social survey of Vermont residents,
  conducted in the early 1990’s to determine various aspects of their demographic, income, and
  employment status. This data set is provided in tabular format, compatible with the SPSS statistical
  software package. 
  
  - VT_DEMO is a spatial dataset of Vermont towns containing employment and income
  metrics from the US census in 1990 and 2000. It is provided in “shapefile” format for use in the ArcGIS
  software package.

"Comparison of Cholesterol Levels in Urban and Rural Guatemalans"
  - guatemal.sav is a dataset containing total serum cholesterol levels (in mg/L) for 94 native Guatemalans, 45 representing residents     of an urban setting,   49 representing residents of a rural region. The researchers were interested in determining whether. The data
  included in the file  are coded 1 for urban residents, 2 for rural residents.

"Implications of Habitat Conditions on Species Survival"
  - habitat.sav contains data on 349 infant squirrels randomly assigned to one of six habitat types, proportional to total acreage
  available in each habitat type, yielding slightly different group sizes among the treatments. The dataset  includes data on survival     time   (in months) and treatment type (habitat unit) to which each individual was assigned.
  
"Investigation of Precipitation Lapse Rates in Vermont"
  - precip.sav: contains average annual precipitation depths (in inches) for 31 stations in Vermont. The elevation of each station is     given in feet. 
  
"Predicting Female Life Expectancy"
  - country.sav includes demographic data for 122 nations. The variables are defined as follows:
    - lifeexpf: female life expectancy
    - urban: percent of the population living in urban areas
    - gdp: gross domestic product per capita
    - docs: number of doctors per 10,000 people
    - radios: number of radios per 100 people
    - hospbed: number of hospital beds per 10,000 people

"Spatial Analysis of Housing Values in Baltimore County, Maryland"
- gwrdata.mdb: an ArcGIS compatible geodatabase 
- BGBACItable.csv: contains the attribute table data from the geodatabase. csv file containing the attribute table data from the geodatabase. 
    - Med_val_al: median house value ($)
    - P_SFDH: percent single family detached homes
    - POWNOCC: percent owner occupied housing
    - P_vac: percent vacant housing
    - Med_rooms: median number of rooms per house
    - Yrsold: median years old for housing
    - D2down: distance to downtown from census block centroid
    - D2prot: distance to protected area from census block centroid
    - Canmean2: mean tree canopy coverage for the block group
    - X: longitude of census block centroid (- for decimal degrees west)
    - Y: latitude of census block centroid

"Autocorrelation and Interpolation of Contaminated Sites"
- lead.xlsx: a collection of 100 sampling sites of soil lead concentrations, measured on a
regularly sampled grid at 1 meter spacing for a pilot study. 
- lead.mdb: a geodatabase (GIS-compatible file) for a randomly selected set of soil samples in a 35 x 35 km study
area. 

"Predicting Erosion from Forestry Practices"
- culvert.sav: contains data for 275 surveyed culverts and associated variable values.  

"Spatially Distributed Regression Modeling in GIS"
- yellowstone.mdb: Yellowstone geodatabase.
  - roaddist – a polygon layer showing distance from roads in the park
  - campsites – a point layer of campsites in the park
  - wolfpacks – a polygon layer showing boundaries of existing wolf pack territories
  - den_locs – a point layer of existing wolf den locations
  - elk – a polygon layer showing elk range in Yellowstone, based on preferred elk browse
